For our project one, we predicted the stock market trend based on i) past data on stock prices and 
ii) based on twitter sentiments.  We used stocks data from google API and Morningstar to answer our 
questions.

For the first part, we analyzed past year's data for five giant tech stocks:  FB, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX and GOOG.  
We tried to answer the following questions:  
#1) What’s the change in stock’s price over time? 
#2 What is the change in volume in the year 2017: 
#3 What was the daily return average of a stock?
#4 What was the moving average(MA)of various stocks?
#5) What was the daily return average of a stock?    
#6) What was the correlation between daily returns of different stocks?
#7) How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?

From the first part, we found that stock trend can be predicted based on past data.

For the second part, We analyzed Vader sentimental analysis for stocks using tweets within last 7 days (since 
twitter API is only available for the past 7 days).  We analyzed giant company stocks from two different 
sectors: tech and pharma industry.  We calculated price change for a three day period and determined tweet 
polarity for those three days and then tried to determine the correlation between them.  We did not find any 
strong correlation between the stock price change and the tweet polarity.  Hence, we concluded that twitter alone 
may not be the best approach to predict stock market trend.
